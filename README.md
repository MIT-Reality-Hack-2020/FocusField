# FocusField

## Inspiration

Our team was sitting in the audience at the Opening Ceremonies of the Reality Hack 2020, after a long and exciting day of meeting people and attending workshops. Though the keynotes were amazing, one of our group members found it hard to focus. Her attention would wander amidst the visual cacophony of phones, people making comments, and other bystanders. At this moment, she wondered if she could make something to help maintain her focus with augmented reality. The Focus Field was thus conceived.

## What it does

The Focus Field encourages and rewards sustained attention by providing augmented visual cues and filters in response to a user's eye movements.

## How we built it
We built this in pieces with each team member fleshing out individual features and testing them to see if they worked. We gradually merged our different portions together.

## Challenges we ran into
None of us had ever developed for Hololens before and there was a lot of initial learning and head-scratching.
We gained many findings from our testing with users on autism and ADHD that challenged our original project direction.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of.. eye-tracking and creating a feature-complete vertical slice of our product. Creating graphics and high fidelity mobile prototype that completes the user's flow with our app. Getting Azure services to work so that the Hololens 2 device would send live data to the cloud. Working iteratively and testing as much as we could with mentors.


## What we learned
How to work with MRTK and Hololens 2. Working with Azure Cloud. Working and designing for use of eye-tracking. Learning about ADHD and autism.


## What's next for The Focus Field
Creating The Focus Field at this hackathon allowed us to have a proof of concept and testable demo to share with a larger and more diverse set of users.
